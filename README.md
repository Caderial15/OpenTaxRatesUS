# OpenTaxRatesUS
A free, community-maintained database of U.S. sales tax rates across all jurisdictional levels (state, county, city, district) and economic nexus thresholds. We're liberating publicly available tax data from expensive subscription services and making it accessible to everyone in a standardized, usable format.
